- In May 2016 the Royal Society announced it was commissioning a study1, funded by Google and Microsoft, to understand the challenges faced by educators delivering computing and computer science and share best practice which can be adopted more widely. The research will establish the progress that has been made since the introduction of the new English computing curriculum (Department for Education, 2013) in September 2014– as well as recognising related curriculum and qualifications reforms across the rest of the UK – identify areas that still need to be addressed, and will be used as the basis of a wider action plan to transform computing in schools. This new project builds upon the Royal Society’s impactful work in this space, Shut Down or Restart? (Royal Society, 2012), a review of ICT and computing education in schools in the United Kingdom (UK). The introduction of a new computing curriculum for 5-16 year-olds in England has, for the first time anywhere, established computer science and computational thinking as foundational subjects alongside English, mathematics and the sciences. England is in effect pioneering a brand new school subject from the age of five2, with the rest of the world watching to see the impact. This is alongside a number of national and international initiatives to reinforce computer science’s position as a mainstream Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) discipline (Guzdial and Morrison, 2016)
