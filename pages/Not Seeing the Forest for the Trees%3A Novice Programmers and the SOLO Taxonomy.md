- **Abstract**: This paper reports on the authors use of the SOLO taxonomy to
  describe differences in the way students and educators solve small
  code reading exercises. SOLO is a general educational taxonomy,
  and has not previously been applied to the study of how novice
  programmers manifest their understanding of code. Data was
  collected in the form of written and think-aloud responses from
  students (novices) and educators (experts), using exam questions.
  During analysis, the responses were mapped to the different levels
  of the SOLO taxonomy. From think-aloud responses, the authors
  found that educators tended to manifest a SOLO relational
  response on small reading problems, whereas students tended to
  manifest a multistructural response. These results are consistent
  with the literature on the psychology of programming, but the
  work in this paper extends on these findings by analyzing the
  design of exam questions.
