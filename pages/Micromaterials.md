- A micromaterial is an [[Open Educational Resource]] that with a few special characteristics:
	- it is tightly focused on one learning objectives
	- it gives automatic feedback (if relevant) so learners can study with minimal guidance
	- ideally it is has some level of [content generation]([[as Code/Content]]) so learners can practice continually without creating hours of extra work for content creators
	- it is (ideally) freely available on the web, and preferably [[Open Source]]
- The term "Micromaterial" was coined by [Adam Leskis](https://adamleskis.com/), and he has [a blog](https://micromaterialsblog.wordpress.com/about/) about them

- open questions
	- #question: what information would someone need to:
		- know if a micromaterial is relevant for them
		- know how the micromaterial can be fit in sequence with their course
		- know what adjustments might be needed for them to use it
	- is using github tags/topics a good first way to discover micromaterials?  later would some sort of stand-alone registry be better?  #question
