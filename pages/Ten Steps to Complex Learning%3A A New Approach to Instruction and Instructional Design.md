- The subject of this chapter, ten steps to complex
  learning (van Merriënboer & Kirschner, 2007),
  was recently published as a practical and modified
  version of the four-component instructional design (4C-ID)
  model originally posited by van Merriënboer in 1997.
  These ten steps are mainly prescriptive and aim to provide
  a practicable version of the 4C-ID model for teachers,
  domain experts involved in educational or training design,
  and less experienced instructional designers. The model
  described here will typically be used to develop educa-
  tional or training programs, which can have a duration
  ranging from several weeks to several years, aimed at the
  acquisition of complex cognitive skills (in this chapter
  referred to as complex learning).
