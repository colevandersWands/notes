- There are various challenges in IT education. Students have difficulties in applying the key concepts, theories and techniques taught in introductory courses. At the same time, the backgrounds of students are becoming more and more diverse. Teachers work with heterogeneous student cohorts. Phenomenographic studies can be used to understand different perspectives of learnersâ€™ understanding. Variation theory is a promising approach to improving the teaching of computing subjects. The theory can be applied to design variations in teaching that make explicit the different aspects of computing concepts. We discuss the role of variation theory in creating diversity in teaching practices to reach students with diverse backgrounds and expectations.
