- [[Unask]] which paradigm(s) are best first.
	- instead, first set the scene:
		- [[Rhetorics of Programming]]: where and how does what you're teaching happen?
		- identify your "core competency" such as planning and collaborating
		- construct your [spiderweb]([[Spiderweb Curriculum]])

	- [[De Nepo Web Dev -- very WIP]]: modules 1-3
