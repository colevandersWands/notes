- the trace button prints a configurable, human readable(ish) trace of a program to the console.
	- learners can configure the trace to focus on different aspects of the program's execution
	- admittedly, it's not the most user friendly for now.  but it has potential
	- the trace button can be used to check hand-written [Trace Tables]([[Study Lenses/Trace Tables]])
	- implemented using [aran](https://github.com/lachrist/aran), a library for JavaScript instrumentation. (thank you Laurent!)
- tracing the same code with different configurations
