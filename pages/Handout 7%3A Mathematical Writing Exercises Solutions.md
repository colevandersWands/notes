		- *after*: Let f (t) be Gryffindorâ€™s score t minutes into a game against Slytherin. ((644b7f4b-e3e9-4d07-9ff3-a9ef0e1d2d6d))
		- key information
			- gryffindor is playing slytherin
			- gryffindor's score $g$ is computable at any point in time $t$ during the game against slytherine:
				- game times form a set ordered of real numbers: $T := \{ t \in \mathbb{R} : 0 <= t <= \textit{end of game} \}$
				- gryffindor scores form an ordered set of integers: $G := \{ g_t \in \mathbb{N} :  g_t   \text{  is gryffindor's score at time  } t \}$
			- there exists a [[surjective]] mapping from T to G defined for all of T:
				- $f : T \to G$
			- f is globberfluxible at $t = 3$
				- this term is not defined, but we know when it applies

		- *before*: The function $x^2 + 1$ is even
		- *after 1:* all elements in the codomain of function $f: x \to x^2 + 1$ (defined over $\mathbb{N}$) are even

		- *before:* On a compact space every real-values continuous function $f$ is bounded.
		- *after 1:* Every real-valued, continuous function on a compact space is bounded.
