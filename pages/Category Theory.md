- (on hold until after some more study with: [[LaTeX]], [[Mathematical Reading, Writing, Translating]], [[Mathematical and Scientific Writing]], [[Handout 7: Mathematical Writing Exercises Solutions]], [[A Mathematician's Lament]])
	- start with [[Introduction to Categories and Categorical Logic]]?
-
- why study category theory
	- to think about and plan research more clearly
		- ((641c9d9b-7184-43f1-8d95-bb0d7d9d118c))
	- understanding it could help design better courses
	- curiosity and interest
	- get some math in my life again
	- it's useful for [[Functional Programming]] and programming in general

- ## Explaining to Me
-
- old try. what are the foundational questions of [[Category Theory]]?
	- try working backwards from definitions: [[class]]/[[object]], [[category]], [[morphism]], composition (associativity, identity), ((645a0f1b-2e59-4b30-9a06-9d6bd0e9626c))
		- *class/object*: what is a "thing", how can you create groups of similar things?  (is this question why the books all start with sets?)
		- *morphism*: what can you do with these things?
		- ... meh. good idea, weak start.  working backwards from definitions is still starting from definitions.
	-
- old try.  more conversational, but still starting from definitions not wondering
	- In category theory you study **Categories**.  In normal life the word "category" loosely refers to a *type of thing*.  In mathematics, a category is a much more specific concept than in normal life.  In normal life you can define a category with a general rule like "fiction is any story that's not true".  But in math you need to be more specific about your categories, to properly define a category you need to be clearly answer these questions:
		- 1. What [[object]]s are you studying?
		  2. What are all of the paths from one [[object]] to another?
		  3. (Associativity) 
		  4. Is there a path from every [[object]] to itself?
	- (... rephrase again, but more formally)
