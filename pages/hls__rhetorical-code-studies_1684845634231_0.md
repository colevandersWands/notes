- These characteristics of code—its rhetorical qualities, the discourse surrounding its development, and the social and cultural contexts in which it is composed and employed—inform the premises on which rhetorical code studies is built.

- Perhaps a rhetorical study, and practice, of code can lead to more software development engaged with the ideologies and values of programmers and users and that works to effect cultural and political change more fully, actively, and explicitly to the benefit of those same populations.

- For a world fundamentally impacted by digital technology—and thus by its software—the arguments we and others make in code have the potential to be read, experienced, and responded to so that we can develop not only more responsible and ethical programs (to use a term coined by Brown 2015) but more responsible and ethical publics as well.

- Such an undertaking involves not simply identifying particular operations, methods, or function structures as possessing specific rhetorical qualities but also recognizing the interplay between lines of code, social interactions between developers(if there are multiple developers involved), bureaucratic procedures influencing particular developers’ contributions to a project, and the softwarefacilitating development activities, to say nothing of the situations surrounding and informing the use of that program once it is released to public audiences.

- Further, I hope that scholars and practitioners outside the field of rhetoric may also find this project valuable for improving education and practice relating to software development by considering what rhetoric has to offer computer science and professional(and, for that matter, amateur) programming activities

- Of particular note for efforts like Scratch and others is the broad push to reframe STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) education as STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, math) so as to build on the widespread support for STEM initiatives. These initiatives, however, tend to avoid direct engagements with rhetoric and code in favor of its political or cultural impact in a given context. This latter avoidance of direct engagement with code (as both text and activity) is of central significance to the argument I make throughout this

- text, as I want to draw attention to the rhetorical activities in which programmers engage, in and around code texts, as they develop software.1 Among the most important public outreach tasks a rhetorician who studies digital technologies can engage in is helping diverse audiences understand not only how those technologies influence audiences toward particular actions but how those same technologies are designed and constructed to influence them. Among the most powerful ways to do this, I suggest, is to draw attention to the appeals and strategies employed in the construction and dissemination of software code among programmers of varying expertise and involvement in a given project. It is these individuals and groups, after all, who decide not only what a program will do but how they will go about making it perform those tasks.

- Finally, in chapter 6, I consider how rhetorical code studies might be further developed in several significant scholarly directions, including— for educational initiatives—how rhetorically informed efforts to program might be assessed by instructors, just as other forms of assessment have been developed for composition in multiple and diverse modes.

- These calls resemble earlier arguments in technical communication (e.g. Miller 1979) for technical documents to be viewed as rhetorical rather than merely instrumental and that writing students cultivate critical and rhetorical literacies regarding technologies in addition to becoming technically proficient in using them (Selber 2004).

- A number of scholars have advocated an alternative approach to theorizing online community rhetoric, one in which digital environments and rhetorical situations are considered fundamentally distinct from those surrounding conventional communities. For example, Brooke(2009) called for a new media reconsideration of the rhetorical canons and of the trivium of classical education, with a focus on how new media demand innovative rhetorical perspectives if we are to understand how we communicate in ways unanticipated in previous contexts.
