	- ### Introduction
		- “Engaged pedagogy does not seek simply to empower students. Any classroom that employs a holistic model of learning will also be a place where teachers grow, and are empowered by the process.” - [[bell hooks]]

		- “two complimentary fallacies... have [limited] thinking about the role of technology in education. The ‘technocentric fallacy’ is illustrated by questions like: ‘How do computers change the way children learn?’...a too-easy rebuttal leads into a complementary fallacy: the ‘just-a-tool fallacy.’ By this I mean the failure to distinguish between tools (reasonably described as ‘just tools’) that improve their users’ ability to do pre-existing jobs, and another kind of “tool”...that are more than “just tools” because of their role in the creation of a job nobody thought to do, or nobody could have done, before.” - [[Seymour Papert]]

			- 1. **Lower the floors**: reduce barriers for designing these kinds of experiences,
			  especially for people who are new to teaching.
			  2. **Widen the walls**: involve educators from backgrounds and domains often
			  not perceived as creative (e.g. health education) as they seek to transition
			  to more creative forms of learning and teaching.
			  3. **Raise the ceilings**: empower experienced educators to extend their craft.
