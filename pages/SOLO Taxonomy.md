- Programming is complicated, there are many concepts to learn and all of the concepts are related in different ways. This means you actually have two kinds of knowledge to build:
	- **Concepts**: The individual concepts of programming, things like *_variables_* and *_APIs_* and *_repositories_*. Studying each of these concepts separately will be important before moving on to ...
	- **Connections**: How the individual concepts are related, each relationship is a new thing to learn! For example once you understand variables and arrays separately, you will still need to study *_reference vs. value_* (how *_variables_* store *_arrays_* in memory).
- **Self-Assessment**: A helpful way to assess your own understanding is to use the *_SOLO Taxonomy_*. From top to bottom, each row in the table below represents the next step in your learning. The first levels of the SOLO Taxonomy (*_Prestructural_*, *_Unistructural_*, *_Multistructural_*) are about understanding **concepts**. The last levels (*_Relational_*, *_Extended Abstract_*) are about understanding and
  mastering **connections**.
