title:: Constrained Coding
> Constrained programming is a coding technique in which the programmer is bound by some condition that forbids certain things or imposes a pattern. Constraints are very common in coding, which often requires the programmer to use a particular paradigm.

- #todo - migrate notes on constrained writing & constraints + creativity
- [[Language Level]], [[Module/Welcome to JS]], [[Process Over Product]], [[Task Class]], [[Programming Paradigms]], [[Module/Separation of Concerns]]
- i wonder about [[Constrained Coding]]
	- does teaching [constraint definition as an explicit step in collaboration](https://github.com/DeNepo/planning-and-collaborating/blob/main/03-constraints.md) help learners complete projects and focus on primary learning objectives? #question
	- would solving the same code challenge several times under different constraints help raise learners' general programming level? #question [[Module/Behavior, Strategy, Implementation]]
	- what practices could be adapted from writing education? #question
