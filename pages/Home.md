- What you're reading is a big work in-progress; I'm trying to organize everything I've learned, experienced and designed while teaching programming into something you might find helpful.
- There are a few ways to find your way through all these notes:
	- [Explore the graph](https://evancole.be/#/graph)
	- [Scroll the list of all pages](https://evancole.be/#/all-pages)
	- Use the search icon in the upper left
	- Pick a #narrative and follow it's thread
	- Explore open #question's
- Don't look for a master plan (just yet at least). For now I'm starting with the first thing that comes to mind then following that train of thought. When that train reaches its terminus I open a random file (notes, code, PDF, anything) and start from there.
	- I'm figuring this out as I go in [[Metanotes]]
- Special thanks all of my students whose patience and collaboration made this possible, all the developers who shared their experience and teaching advice, and my colleagues who made sure I had the time to focus on designing education.
