- There is an increasing recognition that computing education and the profession of computing has failed indigenous learners around the world. In this paper we argue for a reform of tertiary education’s computing curricula so that they address the needs of both indigenous and non-indigenous learners. To achieve this, we must first consider the role of computing as a negative colonising force that continues to the present. This paper integrates traditional methods of storytelling to provide context for a reframing of computing as a decolonising force. A case study of the New Zealand context where Māori have been underserved by both computing education and the computing profession, is used to identify systemic barriers. We propose a process of partnership that empowers indigenous communities to work with industry and education to imagine a computing profession that positively contributes to thriving decolonised practice. And then how can computer science education contribute to that? We then canvas some potential directions a transformation of computing education might take. This paper is not intended to replace or preempt partnerships or indigenous self-determination, but to inspire computer science educators towards developing an approach that improves outcomes for all learners.

- Mkansi describes decolonising education as a “baffling endeavour” for hard sciences [10]. This bafflement can be imagined in a perspective that things Māori have nothing to do with learning how to write efficient code or implement network protocols (for example). This systemic shortcoming is mostly not from a position of arrogance but a genuine bewilderment of how you could teach a thing that is seemingly culturally-independent and abstract in ways that better align with te ao Māori (the Māori world)

- It is likely that an outcome of transformation and unification will be a te reo Māori (Māori language) version of each qualification and“mainstream” English version. A “Social Report” [12] found that while 55% of Māori reported they could speak more than a few words or phrases in te reo Māori, for only 23% was this “very well” or “fairly well”. So, it would be a mistake to rely solely on a te reo version to carry the load here, the mainstream version has to decolonise too.

- . But the concept of computing as a colonising force is underexplored and there is little guidance as to what “decolonised computing” might look like - or even just computing as a positive force in decolonisation. So, the nature of computing as a colonising force must first be considered.

- Writing of Industrial Design, Torreta and Reitsma [19] argue that it “emerged from a specific nature/culture and political situation; it is therefore a situated field that echoes the worldview of where it was created”. In computing’s terms, an apparent lack of values does not mean technology is benign, rather that we have come to presume that efficiency, speed and productivity are values that match societal aspirations.

- In attempting to decolonise the 4th Industrial Revolution, Maringe [2] sets out high level principles for decolonising curriculum development. The second of these principles (the first is about a critical visioning process) is that “there are no cross-disciplinary hierarchies of knowledge”. Decolonisation of curriculum therefore involves collaborative knowledge creation rather than the exclusion of other forms of knowledge.

- The New Zealand re/development of the school (K12) CS curricula into two Digital Technologies and Hangarau Matahiko (DT/HM, [42, 43]) curricula is useful for scene-setting. Crucially, as a first observation, it is not a direct translation. For example, while the English version puts technical intervention first, the te reo version “begins with the Māori world and its relevance to the changing world. They must also focus on the values, skills, and technical knowledge of the world they are familiar with” [43].

- But, we argue, this would be the wrong way of looking at it. Bennett [45] uses the term “Anupholesteraphobia” the fear of not being able to cover all the material. Rather than something to cram into an already overcrowded curriculum, we can take from Bennett the approach of seeing Indigenous knowledge as the context for computing, a basis for deeper learning, or even a reason for learning

- This is not a conclusion, but a vision of an island over the horizon [46]. We have a clear need to decolonise the CSEd curriculum. This will improve the outcomes for Indigenous communities and for a richer computing profession. This decolonisation needs to be done by the Indigenous communities themselves led by Indigenous CS and CSEd practitioners, with assistance, where requested, from allies within the wider CSEd and CS communities.
