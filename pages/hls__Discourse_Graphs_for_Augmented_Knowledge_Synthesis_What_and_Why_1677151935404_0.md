- The advanced understanding from synthesis can be a powerful force multiplier for choosing effective studies and operationalizations [van Rooij and Baggio, 2021, McElreath and Smaldino, 2015, Scheel et al., 2020], and may be especially necessary for problems where it is difficult or impossible to construct decisive experimental tests (e.g., the issue of mask efficacy for reducing community transmission [Howard et al., 2020]); indeed, scientific progress may not even be tractable without adequate synthesis (as theory), even with advanced methods and data [Jonas and Kording, 2017]: as Allen Newell famously said, "You canâ€™t play twenty questions with nature and win" [Newell, 1973
