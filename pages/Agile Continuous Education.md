- ACE describes the need to entwine educational sciences and practice, but what i've seen offers no clear models for how this could work. A few thoughts on how ACE could be adopted in [[Computing Education]] :
	- [TCER]([[Computing Education Research as a Translational Transdiscipline]]) gives a conceptual framework for connecting research to practice in computing education
	- [[Research Programmes/Translational]] help approach large, seemingly untractable, problems
	- [[Agile Computing Education Research]] methodologies keep learners at the center and all [[CER Stakeholders]] in the loop
	- [[Translational Sprints]] provide a way to continuously and flexibly deliver rigorously-designed education
	- micromasters in an ACE setting could be ideal venues to host [[Model Course]]s
