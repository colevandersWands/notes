- This article explores the connection between computer programming (coding) and traditional composition. It first looks at how a discussion about adopting the open source community’s copyleft publishing model suggests a deeper parallel between coding and composition than has been previously acknowledged. By repositioning the rhetorical triangle as a coding triangle, the article argues that the act of writing programs for a machine informs the process of constructing an audience, in traditional composition. To better inform the act of how a traditional writer invokes an audience, the article summarizes how Walter J. Ong has characterized this process. The article then examines how Claudia Herbst’s portrayal of the cultural power of computer code raises questions as to how computer users similarly invoke an author. It also briefly considers how computer programming texts have characterized coding as an act of writing. Next the parallels between coding and composition and their treatment thus far in composition literature and new media theory are considered. The article considers Alfred Kern’s work in employing BASIC programming to teach grammar and composition and then offers suggestions for thinking of new ways that a knowledge of coding can inform the teaching of writing. This article concludes with guidelines for writing teachers who wish to incorporate computer coding into their curriculum.

- As Herbst (2002) has pointed out, beyond the fact that writing computer code substitutes a machine for a human reader, code is a form of text that lacks a narrator.

- But while student programmers might become so focused on the machine’s reaction to the code as to lose sight of the end user, the human reaction to the program, the hallmark of the professional coder is the successful management of both audiences. Successful use of code to teach writing will create an awareness of both human and machine readers.

- the assumption is that the audience can only receive that message by reading the text: The author will not be able to mediate the reader’s interpretation of his or her message once the text is turned over to the readers.

- the reader is thwarted by any number of obstacles on the way to that message, not the least of which will be the notion that every reader creates his or her own subjective meaning from text, independent of the author’s intentions.

- Still the writer bravely presses onward and, after reading the written product, comes to realize that although the text is different from what he or she imagined, the text is now in control. At some point the writer surrenders control of the document by publishing it, mailing it, posting it, filing it, destroying it, or turning it over to someone else, depending on the writer’s acquiescence to readers’ demands.

- the professional editor might act as a gateway to publication, holding absolute power of acceptance or rejection while a student writer’s relationship with a writing instructor would merge the role of reader and commenter.

- the professional programmer might differ from the student programmer in his or her construction of an audience. While the student programmer is much more likely to view the machine as the audience for his or her writing, as it is the machine that must first react to the text, the professional coder is more likely to envision the software user as his or her audience.

- In fact writers must create an abstract conception of their audience, which Ong labeled “readership” (p. 11). And Ong reasoned that the way writers conceive of this readership is to fall back on models from earlier experiences reading fiction.

- His next assertion is that the text’s reader is cast into a fictional role created by the author: “A reader has to play a role in which the author cast him, which seldom coincides with his role in the rest of actual life” (p. 12).

- The human reader reading is certainly much more complex and undefined than the machine processor, but the human and machine both cannot respond to the writer’s intentions. They can only respond to the text.
