alias:: TCER Model

- The foundation of Translational Computing Education Research is the [[Translational Continuum]]
- Here's the current diagram of TCER: ((63fb3f26-fae2-470b-969b-046e4ca0c385))
- The structure and vocabulary of the TCER Model could be used to organize [[Translational Research Programmes]], which could be used to target broad challenges in [[CE]] and (hopefully) to secure more substantial funding and collaborations
- **Future Work:**
	- emphasize the transitions / liminal zones, like in [[Evaluating Translational Research: a Process Marker Model]]
	- the initial model if very high level, and does not well describe how to conceptualize involvement across different educational contexts.
		- Perhaps CER is globally an [interdiscipline](((6418f99c-2686-4525-a486-26020e96d3db))). And local [transdisciplines](((6418f99c-e7da-4483-b96b-e7af1f89a915))) arise as depth of expertise, [[Boundary Objects]] and bodies of knowledge accumulate at specific [[Trading Zones]] #question
			- for examples, the transdiscipline of k12 CER, or of professional CE, or of university CS education, or of [ethics & computing](((641903e5-2010-4848-858b-ee70d29521cf)))
			- question inspired by [[Integrating Ethics into Computer Science Education: Multi-, Inter-, and Transdisciplinary Approaches]]
			- what's the relationship to these local transdisciplines and [[TRP]]s? #question
				- TRPs concentrate on one context, as would these local transdisciplines.
				- perhaps extended or multiple TRPs lead to new local transdisciplines?
				- or the emergence of local transdisciplines and associated expertise make TRPs more feasible?
			- these transdisciplinary subdisciplines may be the focus of more open-ended funding? #question ((6418f99b-22b1-46ff-80a2-7a0c53c49eea))
	- Phase 2 has a narrow focus on running controlled experiments to explore and validate theories.  There are more approaches for exploring and validating theories. We would like to make room for all of them in our model.
	- consider different layouts for the diagram that better capture the spirit of TCER. this could mean a rounder or spirally diagram, or who knows?
	- Where are the people? They never appear directly in the model.  A new draft of the TCER model/diagram could represent different stakeholders and their relationships within CER.
