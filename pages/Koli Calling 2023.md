	- ***Discussion papers*** with up to 10 pages **single-column** excluding references and, optionally, supplemental material disseminate and discuss new ideas and promising initiatives in computing education practice or research. They will be reviewed based on the quality of the discussion, their use of appropriate evidence or argumentation, and their potential to be of interest to the community. **Examples **of discussion papers include:
		- *Proposition papers*, which propose an innovation, debate a theoretical issue, or advance a cause. The argumentation must be solidly grounded in the research literature. A discussion paper must provide fresh perspectives or insights and present a compelling case to indicate how it promotes discussion and raises questions for future research to answer.
			- we try to propose the questions, and provide a theory+tools to begin answering them
