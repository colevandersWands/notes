- The conference on grand challenges, held in Newcastle on 30 and 31 March 2004, occurred at a particularly opportune time. The strand on the educational aspects was particularly relevant and the idea innovative in the sense that this was the first occasion on which a grand challenge event with a focus on educational issues in computing had taken place. This paper provides some of the background and includes a distillation of the educational challenges that emerged from that event.
