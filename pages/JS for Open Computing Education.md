- [JS for Open Computing Education](https://github.com/colevandersWands/fosdem-2019) is something I made in 2019 with big ideas about accessibly open-sourced computing education.  It is many things:
	- a conference presentation: [slides](https://github.com/colevandersWands/fosdem-2019), [video](https://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1308/js_teaching_tool.mp4)
	- an exploration form and medium.  How could I use a github repository and gh-pages hosting to publish and essay, examples and slides in one place?  Besides curiosity, this was practice for organizing open research and education
	- a public statement of what I wanted to work towards over the next several years.  that future is now
- *disclaimers*:
	- I wrote this before having a more realistic idea how to program, teach, or manage a school.  The big ideas are there but many of the details (especially the code) are off-kilter
	- many of the links to examples are dead - they point to a github org named *Janke Learning*, which has since been supplanted by [[De Nepo]]. Most of the examples have been moved to my personal account ([colevandersWands](https://github.com/colevandersWands)), but you're not missing too much
- I present 5 high-level principles that should underly all open computing education. Here's a quick summary of each:
	- **[(Intellectual) Honesty](https://github.com/colevandersWands/fosdem-2019#honesty)**:  What is the best way to balance the [[Radical Novelty]] of computing with [Rule 6](((31d213a3-c0b5-42a0-8a14-4c7fee04a285)))?  #question
	- **[Agency](https://github.com/colevandersWands/fosdem-2019#honesty)**:  Digital agency should be embedded into the learner & educator's experience by providing educational resources which they can realistically adapt to their circumstances.
	- **[Ownership](https://github.com/colevandersWands/fosdem-2019#ownership)**: Students, teachers, communities and families should feel that their education is theirs. That it covers what is needed for them to thrive in their own context, and is delivered in a mode that complements their lives. For this to be possible, educators should be able to adapt any course to fit their needs with no more technical knowledge than is necessary to teach the course.
	- **[Integration](https://github.com/colevandersWands/fosdem-2019#integ-ration):** Computing education should build a wholistic understanding of the creative & controlling role programming plays at the center of a digital society.
	- **[Preparation](https://github.com/colevandersWands/fosdem-2019#preparation):** Learners completing an introductory course in computing should be better prepared to take their next step in life, should that be deeper into programming or not.
- And 5 design principles that can be used when developing open educational resources:
	- **[[Explicitly Teach the Implicit]]**: Take the space in your learning objectives and the time in your class to explicitly teach skills that experienced developers take for granted, or don't even notice.  Such as knowing where to start reading in a file of code, or how to write a good internet search. Don't leave these skills to be (maybe) learned correctly by trial and error.
	- **[[Process Over Product]]**: Focus your teaching and assessment on the steps a learner takes to complete an assignment, not the final product.  This principle should be applied at every level of curriculum design from the overall course objectives, to assessment, to every granular exercise and reference.
	- **[[Context is Content]]:** Where and how a learner studies something should also be a learning objective.  Do your best to align your learner's study workflows with realistic workflows (whatever that means in your setting), this can help learners avoid challenges with [[Skill Transfer]] and save time in the long run.
	- **[[Full Complexity, Max Simplicity]]:** Instead of introducing a whole bunch of concepts then expecting learners to [piece them together]([[Connections are Concepts]]) in a final project, it is better to start with projects that already resemble the workflows and structure of a final project but with the simplest possible technical details. This was heavily inspired by [4CID]([[Four Component Instructional Design]])

	- **[[Open Source]] !== [[Open Education]]:** Resources can have an open license but not support open education if it's *unrealistic* for a learner or educator to adapt the resources to their needs.  On the flip side, resources with closed source or licenses can support open education if a learner or educator *can* adapt them to their needs. The gold standard for computing education should be resources that fully satisfy both definitions of "open".

- JS for Open CE is the seed for much of my current work including:
	- an [early diagram](https://github.com/colevandersWands/fosdem-2019/blob/master/rhetorical-situation.png) of the [[Rhetorics of Programming]]
	- [[Context First]] curriculum design can be traced back to [[Process Over Product]]
	- [[Full Complexity, Max Simplicity]] let to the [[Rhetorics of Programming]], the [[Spiderweb Curriculum]], and [[De Nepo Web Dev]]
	- [[Context is Content]] is one of the core design principles behind [[Study Lenses]] and [[Learning as Code]]
	- *(Intellectual) Honesty* eventually led to a style of example code designed to isolate [language concepts]([[Connections are Concepts]]) and to be studied in the debugger.  It also led to many features in [[Study Lenses]] and [[Inside JS]]
	- [[Process Over Product]] & [[Explicitly Teach the Implicit]] guided the high-level and low-level design of [[Welcome to JS]] and [[Inside JS]]
	- ... more, if I come back to finish this list later
