- A lot of the current innovations of education using technology haven’t fundamentally changed the historical approaches to education. They use a lot of input, expecting learners to absorb the material and be able to transform it into useful skills. Some of these efforts do involve interactive exercises, but because they’re often curated by humans, they don’t scale very well to provide extended practice for each skill, nor are they representative of authentic contexts for using the skills that are being taught.
- In addition, a lot of these are free resources, and even sometimes open-source, but they are almost all monoliths that can’t be adapted or remixed for different contexts. We’re interested in explicitly making things composable and connected at a higher level of abstraction. Learners and teachers can be empowered to create their own customized curriculum and learning path based on existing materials, but only involving the ones they personally need to focus on. We are aware of the [reusability paradox](https://opencontent.org/docs/paradox.html) and are not proposing a new format or system for open content. We just believe that learners & teachers should only be limited by pedagogical concerns, not technical ones.
- [[Open Education]]
	- Taking cues from the DevOps movement, we aim to treat content as cattle, and also to spread local learnings globally. Small modular modules are preferred, as they're more composable and like the bazaars of the Unix philosophy. ([[as Code]])

	- In recognition of the [[Reusability Paradox]] , we also intend to create the infrastructure to create fast prototypes and adapt existing ones. For example an API to provide, on demand, functions of specific difficulty levels, features, etc.
	- We also want to drive adoption of more exploratory investigation into ways to inform the content created for Computing Education; for example, corpus analysis of docs to inform materials for "how to read docs".
- [[Open Research]]
	- We want to encourage open research and replication in Computing Education by making prototypes used in studies immediately available to all researchers under an open license. Researchers can share their research questions, experimental designs and interventions before running experiments and their data afterwards, all in a single repository.
	- Replications following the same or different methodologies can be tracked via forks, making related research more cumulative and navigable.
