	- we need to #unask what programming to teach first, and instead ask "how do we teach _how_ and _why_ programming happens?"
	- computing education's "first" could be the [[Rhetorics of Programming]], with different [[Rhetorical Situation]]s defined for different educational contexts

	- these RSs could be layered into a [[Spiderweb Curriculum]].  i can imagine learning paths being described as [[Knowledge Graph]] of RSs, where learners get to specialize not by deciding _what_ languages to learn but by deciding _where_ and _how_ they'd like to apply what they learn.
		- this approach could make it easier to approach the "CS0", "programming for non-majors", or "programming in X discipline" question by actually providing one introductory class for anyone who will eventually need to work with code.
	- i imagine the first modules taken by everyone could be:
		- 1. *multiple humans collaborating on one body of text*. Objectives: IDE, git/hub, task management, collaboration, "code" review - [[Module/Workflows]] 
		  2. *multiple humans collaborating on a text that a computer must also understand*. this could be covered with HTML & CSS because it's motivating, static pages easily go public, there is no heavy [[Notional Machine]] for markup languages. Objectives: task decomposition, code quality, development methodologies, ... - [[Module/Agile Development]] 
		  3. *multiple humans developing for a computer to reach other humans*. Objectives: design thinking, ethics of software, user empathy, ... - [[Module/UX-UI Design]]
		- a possible bonus to starting this way is the (relative) domain-independence of building a static web page.  learners can [bring their own culture]([[Culturally Responsive Computing: a theory revisited]]) to the projects.
		- emphasizing [[Process Over Product]] would additionally free learners to choose the _topic_ of their projects without evading the primary [[Learning Objectives]]
	- after this shared introduction to the social, collaborative and rhetorical nature of programming learners could move on to specialize in different languages & domains
