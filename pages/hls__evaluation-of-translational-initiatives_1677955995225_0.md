- The perception that many promising results from basic biomedicine have not systematically contributed to medical treatments and, ultimately, health care improvements, has led to a wide range of publicly funded initiatives aiming at facilitating the ‘translation’ of scientific discoveries into beneficial applications and practices. Many of these initiatives have been branded as‘Translational Research’ (TR), a term widely applied to large research programmes, research activities, and even academic journals. With the popularity of the term, a debate has emerged about the models of research that are to be considered ‘translational’. Consequently, the ways in which TR should be analysed and, more specifically, the approaches to the evaluation of TR programmes are also the subject of debate. Given the substantial investments in TR programmes, the definition of TR evaluation strategies and approaches has become an important element of the policy process. In a context of ambiguity about the type of activities to be considered as TR, evaluation approaches and practices can play an important role in determining what actions and outcomes are conceived, in practice, to be relevant and significant, and in doing so, shaping the future nature of TR initiatives. This article discusses the dominant approaches to TR evaluation and proposes an alternative evaluation framework, which would have implications both for TR evaluation processes and for the future shaping of TR programmes.

- A focus on outputs and time lags has some advantages. For instance, it allows the use of traditional indicators, such as scientific publications, by linking them to a ‘marker’. This may be convenient since traditional indicators are easily available, but their application may reinforce some of the processes and practices that TR is supposed to combat. For instance, basic scientists can be assessed according to their published output, particularly the time it takes for publication to take plac

- The first step of an alternative TR evaluation strategy is to determine the, implicit or explicit, ‘programme theory’ underpinning the TR initiative under study. In other words, we need to define the policy goals in terms of the proximities that are to be improved and the process by which such improvements are expected to occur

- In adopting this approach, we are proposing that the immediate goal of a TR initiative is to address the problem of the distances separating the different groups involved in medical research. The ‘translational gaps’ are due to excessive distance in one or more significant dimensions

- For instance, too large a cognitive distance can be problematic, but so can too much cognitive overlap; cognitive proximity is positive only up to a certain level. A specific programme theory must reflect this problem of balance
