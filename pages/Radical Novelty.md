- i wonder about [[Radical Novelty]]
	- does radical novelty only exist in relation to previous experience domains of knowledge? #question
		- what is common experience to one group could be radical novelty for another
	- are there levels of Radical Novelty that could be measured (relative to an individual or domain) by some sort of [proximity]([[Proximity and Innovation: a Critical Assessment]])? #question
	- is it uncritical to unequivocally call something a radical novelty, even when it has been internalized by another group/domain for a long time? #question
	- taking all those ^ questions together, is it better to talk about _relative_ and _graded_ radical novelties, instead of absolute ones? #question
