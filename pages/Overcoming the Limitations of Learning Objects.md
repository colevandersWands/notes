- **Abstract:** There are a number of issues facing those who wish to employ learning objects in the
  facilitation of learning. There are a number of issues facing those who wish to employ
  learning objects to facilitate learning. These issues are not, however, inherent in the
  component-based paradigm. The first section of this paper describes some of the most
  difficult issues to be resolved. In the second section, we present a model of the use of
  learning objects that is grounded in a project-based paradigm. In the third section, we
  describe the manner in which we believe the new model overcomes the problems
  outlined in the first section.
