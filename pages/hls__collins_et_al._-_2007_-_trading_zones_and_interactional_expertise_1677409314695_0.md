- rather as a cowrie shell might be an ornament for one tribe, a unit of currency for another tribe, and your grandmother’s soul for another tribe. To think of the cowrie shell as the ‘same thing’ in each of these cases is to privilege a certain kind of analyst’s viewpoint

- Not all trade is conducted in trading zones—at least, not according to our definition. We define ‘trading zones’ as locations in which communities with a deep problem of communication manage to communicate. If there is no problem of communication there is simply ‘trade’ not a‘trading zone’.

- He claims the problem is solved by the development of ‘in-between’ vocabularies through which communication can be accomplished. The simplest of these ‘inter-languages’ is a ‘jargon’, more complex is a ‘pidgin’, while a ‘creole’ is a new language in itself. Galison applies this metaphor to science

- In this case the result is a new expertise in biochemistry which involves a full-blown creole which can be taught as a free-standing language/culture to new generations of students.

- the science and technology being imposed from the top down on the assumption that, since science gives access to universal truths, adjustments for local conditions are otiose and there is no reason to meld the expert culture with the non-expert or even for the elite to try to understand the non-expert view of the world

- Interactional expertise is the product of a successful linguistic socialization. Although expressed as language alone, it cannot be too heavily stressed, interactional expertise is tacit knowledge-laden and context specific

- We could say that the social scientists were engaged in two simultaneous projects: trying to become interactional experts in the worlds of the various negotiating parties and trying to build an inter-language—in this case a common language of measurement—that both parties would share

- Thus, for example, the green chemist and the architect had to understand enough of the manufacturing processes to be sure they followed the protocol, whilst the mill owner had to understand the guiding principles and protocol well enough to be able to embody them in the design. Nevertheless, the parties did not become contributors to each other’s fields nor was any new vocabulary developed—at least, not in the first instance.

  4. The evolution of trading zones
- This possibility is realised when departments are set up, textbooks are produced and what was once a radical and innovative experiment becomes a normal science research program.

- Moreover, to the extent that genuinely novel ideas come from ‘left field’ or from those with a relatively low degree of inclusion, then the top-right hand quadrant seems to be the best location for developing new interdisciplinary partnerships.
