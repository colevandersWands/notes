	- the paper emphasizes informing composition teaching with code?
		- if so, i'm suggesting the inverse

		- "surrenders control" of code -> running it, the computer takes over.  PR, your colleagues.  User uses the software, [[Devs watching QA test the product]].
	- the paper compares editors to compilers.  is this an interesting perspective for novice-friendly errors and warnings? #question

			- can [[Rhetorics of Programming/Apps]] help students write for both audiences earlier in their learning simply by making this explicit? #question
			- is this quote overlooking code review?
			- maybe it's more like _computer -> code review -> user_ where the experienced developer thinks backwards through this chain when writing their code? #question (compared to writers who have one stage fewer _editor -> audience_)

		- replace "readership" with [[Notional Machine]], and "reading fiction" with "following instructions" then you're talking about learning to program
		- ((646f6f58-d70c-4108-96bc-6b57e8169b6e))
			- the equivalent "fictional role" in programming is [[Misconception]]s of the [[Notional Machine]], they don't coincide with realities of the [[Notional Machine]]
	- ((646f7fe2-3331-4f77-b071-673c558ae366))
		- true, if you only consider the interpreter.  untrue once you consider other developers reading your code. -> [[If Hemingway Wrote JavaScript]]
	- #question How do things like readme-first, documentation-first or [[Literate Programming]] interact with this paper?
	- ((646f81ac-6a0a-4b92-9f1e-9c252fb4b0a6))
		- this sentence doesn't well distinguish the differences in experience with well-written code and a well-designed user experience. the two can be uncorrelated, and the same experience can be architected in many different ways - [[Programming Paradigms]]
		- the nested rhetorical triangles in [[Rhetorics of Programming/Apps]] addresses this
			- ((646f8228-b729-487b-ba0e-2d69817ef6ec))
	- ((646f8351-fab2-4004-9318-a463fdc3ab75))
		- With coding the "text"/"reader" interaction can be considered at different levels by the developer:
		  1. computer / instructions
		  2. developer / source code
		  3. user / interactions or interface
	- ((646f850c-381f-4dd3-8fd6-5674becd4a67)) ((646f851a-8bec-4634-bfe5-05b7e7830fbb))
		- 100% a [[Misconception]] for beginner programmers
		- framing [[Tracing]] as an exercise in [[Notional Machine]] building in a [[Rhetorical Situation]] helps avoid this [[Misconception]].  (Anecdotal evidence from teaching [[Module/Welcome to JS]] )

		- [[The Rhetorical Situation]]
	- ((646fc019-9b08-4daa-bd25-1f82ef75d111))
		- a good analogy for [[Module/UX-UI Design]]?  just replace "computer" with "user"

		- is there a meaningful way to inverse this list for inclusion of rhetorics in programming courses? #question
		- ((646fc205-86f6-4c29-b348-ce452402a877))
			- view the inclusion of rhetorics as a process with an open timeline.  you don't need or want to change overnight the successful pedagogy you've developed during your teaching career. focus on developing small rhetorical exercises that parallel the programmer's development of meaningful software and layer in the rhetorics.
		- ((646fc276-66ae-446c-935a-0b9c60846dcd))
			- A familiar cliché holds that the definition of a writing expert is someone who knows something you don't.  Therefore, everyone is both an expert and a novice.  This is stil la programming class, and you're still a programming teacher. Even if you have a lot of writing experience to share, remember that the rhetorical portion of the content is to used as a tool for better programming.  You also may have learners with more rhetorical experience than you, embrace this.  You still have more experience programming, and together you can draw stronger connections than alone.

		- ((646fc348-376c-4a1a-8338-a944f54b532a))
			- work with whichever rhetorical situation you feel most comfortable.  ...

		- ... but the time has arrived for computing scholars to claim rhetorics as their own.  Programming is rhetorical.  Once we are comfortable with that idea, then we will find a new arena for the excitement of programming.
