- helps to give an implicit need/motivation for [[Learning Objectives]]
	- from the designer's end: a helpful tool for deciding what to include and exclude
	- from the learner's perspective: gives meaning and anchoring for [[Learning Objectives]] , even seemingly useless ones ([[Learner Trust]])
	- places collaboration, communication and other "soft skills" unavoidably at the center of everything
	- when used alongside the [[Rhetorics of Programming]], it also places social and ethical questions center stage.
- An example of a "table of contents" for a [[Web Development]] spiderweb curriculum
	- It's helpful to imagine this curriculum as a spider web with two types of thread:
		- **Skills**: The lines going out from the center represent the skills you will practice each and every week.
		- **Technologies**: The circles going out from the center represent the languages and technologies you will learn in each module.
	- The *Workflows* modules starts in the center of this spider's web. You will already be practicing all of the skills but with projects that use only Markdown. Because Markdown is small and simple you will be free to focus on more important things like communication and code review.
	- After you have practiced working on full group projects written in markdown, you will expand to the second circle with the *Agile Development* module. This is when you learn how to collaboratively plan and develop web pages written with HTML and CSS. You will continue practicing all of the skills you learned in *Workflows*, only now the programming languages will be more complex.
	- ... and so on, forever! This curriculum is just the beginning. Your web will continue to grow after you finish this course and add your own threads of new skills, languages and technologies.

- i wonder about [[Spiderweb Curriculum]]
	- does it help learners feel that they belong in computing? #question
		- feedback and my experience says yes, because it shows that the primary interest of computing is not only writing code. and that executive and interpersonal skills are top priority
