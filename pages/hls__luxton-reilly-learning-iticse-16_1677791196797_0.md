- The orthodox view that “programming is difficult to learn” leads to uncritical teaching practices and poor student outcomes. It may also impact negatively on diversity and equity within the Computer Science discipline. But learning to program is easy — so easy that children can do it. We make our introductory courses difficult by establishing unrealistic expectations for novice programming students. By revisiting the expected norms for introductory programming we may be able to substantially improve outcomes for novice programmers, address negative impressions of disciplinary practices and create a more equitable environment.

- It is unclear whether or not programming concepts are more inter-related than other subjects that do not typically have binomial grade distributions. However, a study of exam questions by Petersen et al. [24] indicated that the exam questions used in CS1 were highly inter-related,

- It is not necessarily the case that programming concepts are densely intertwined, but rather, our assessment instruments consist of questions that are densely intertwined and do not give students the opportunity to show which concepts they understand and which they do not.

- This is almost certainly a problem with the assessment of novice programming skills, derived from a mismatch between the progress that a novice programmer can realistically make in a single course and the established norms of expectation for what we think novice programmers should be able to achieve after a single course.
