- Research Questions. To create a collaborative process for teachers and researchers outside of a research practice partnership, we piloted a facilitated process in which CS middle school teachers and CS education researchers collaboratively created CS teacher practice briefs. Our research question for this study was: In what ways are teachers impacted by the process of creating teacher practice briefs in collaboration with researchers?

- Methodology. We conducted a qualitative study, using a semi-structured interview protocol to interview five teachers and three researchers to gain an understanding of how this process impacted the participants. We used thematic content analysis to identify several subthemes across our pre-established themes: motivation for teachers to participate, impacts on teachers, perceived impacts on students, and impacts on researchers.

- Findings. We found that the impact on teachers mirrored impacts found on teachers who engage in Research Practice Partnerships, including increased self-efficacy, expanded professional networks, and changed classroom practices.

- Implications. By bringing researchers and educators together with a clear focus on equity-based problems of practice in CS education, the results display a multitude of positive impacts. Teachers indicate that they are are positively impacted, researchers develop a clear understanding of realistic practices, and students are peripherally impacted through changed practices in the classroom. Therefore, the most significant contribution to advance the disciplinary understanding is the potential for this new process to decrease the gap between research and practice.

- Problem. K-12 teachers face many challenges when teaching a new subject like computer science (CS). They are often far removed from the research being conducted to identify evidence-driven solutions to these challenges. Likewise, researchers are also often removed from the challenges of classroom practices that teachers face when teaching CS.

- Although RPPs have been shown to have positive impacts, RPPs are multi-year projects that can require significant resources and time commitments from all involved parties. Even when RPPs are able to receive appropriate levels of funding, the intensity and longevity of RPPs can be a barrier for practitioners to participate.

- This type of work, where a teacher takes on the role of a researcher in their classroom, mirrors what is known as action research and can be very beneficial. In general, action research is the process where participants (i.e., teachers) “examine their own educational practice systematically and carefully”

- However, in literature, coaching is presented as mostly uni-directional with(1) researchers coaching teachers on instructional practices involving new curricula and pedagogical practices and (2) other more experienced teachers coaching teachers with less experience [6, 48]

- One of the challenges addressed in this research study, as compared to RPPs, is the decrease in time spent on the project. RPPs are designed in a way that often spans multiple years. However, time barriers often impact the overall projects. Therefore, we designed this partnership to span one semester, which therefore decreased, however did not eradicate, the time commitment barrier.
