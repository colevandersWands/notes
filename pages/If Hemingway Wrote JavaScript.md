- ## From the introduction...
- Recently I had a dream in which I set homework assignments for Ernest Hemingway and twenty-four other literary luminaries. Each author received one of five tasks--common coding problems, mostly mathematical--which they were to solve using JavaScript.
- To my astonishment, after a few days, completed assignments started arriving in my mailbox. Still more remarkable, with the exception of Kafka's accursed effort, they all seemed to work.
- Naturally this was all too good to keep to myself so I've reproduced their solutions in this book. To help put the answers in context, I've written a short biography of each author, and followed their code with a brief explanation of what I think they were up to. As a respite between assignments I've included some poetic interludes: long forgotten odes documenting their author's struggle with everyone's favorite programming language.
- Enjoy!
