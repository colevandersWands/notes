- ## Abstract
	- Conducting an effective literature review is an essential step in all scientific work. However, the process is difficult, particularly for interdisciplinary work. Here, we articulate a key avenue for improvement for literature review tools: supporting the appropriate unit of interaction, which we argue is a “grounded claim”, a concise statement linked to key contextual details such as evidence. However, there are significant cognitive and interaction costs in creating them. We share insights from our development of a prototype literature review tool, the Knowledge Compressor, that aims to lower these costs.
