		- > And yet, despite these tensions and limitations, I think that those of us in academia must find ways to think bigger, even within our constraints. There are a few reasons for this. First, we can’t afford to not fundamentally change our material realities; with climate change promising to disrupt every facet of life, with democratic institutions fragmenting, with income inequality threatening peace, and with the ever present racial, ethnic, gender, ability, and class oppression eating away at our collective ability to thrive, we can’t waste any more time polishing edges and refining long accepted ideas. We have to forge ahead on different visions of the future; the public needs to be able to imagine them, and we need to be able to realize them. Only a fraction of our work in research is helping with these goals.

		- > Experiment with funding models that are less about concrete projects and more about long term trajectories that are contingent on the making the structural changes above. For example, I could imagine writing a proposal that says *“My university and research community have restructured incentives and our community would like to move in this direction; ten years of funding please.”*
