- (from [[De Nepo]] web dev course)
- Programming is communication. It's also a lot of other things, but this curriculum will focus on the different ways you communicate with your code.
  When you write code you are really just writing a text document, exactly like you might write an email or a note. The biggest difference between an email and a computer program is ***who you are writing for***.
  When you write an email you're writing for the person who will be reading it. When you write a computer program you are writing for 3 very different audiences at the same time! One single document (your code) needs to be understandable to:
	- **Developers**: A developer needs to read your code and understand what you were trying to do and why.
	- **Computers**: Your code needs to have *_perfect_* syntax so the computer can parse it, and you must write instructions that are allowed by the programming language or the computer will throw an error.
	- **Users**: The instructions you give to the computer must create an intuitive and pleasant experience for the user.
- Being a developer means understanding how all these characters interact, then communicating with everyone involved to deliver quality software within your project's constraints. This diagram shows the different channels of communication in a software project:
