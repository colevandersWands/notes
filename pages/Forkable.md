	- Open Source Educational Resources are not by default Open Education:Â [Open Source !== Open Education](((63f61887-d67b-4632-91d9-9b7ed2f1c0ff)))
	- Forkability: The barriers to entry between clicking the "fork" button, and adapting/applying the resource to your context
	- Open Source only become Open Education when it's forkability is within the means/expertise of participating educators and students: [Agency & Ownership](((63f606ee-85f7-42d7-aba8-d572e11010f0)))
- Below are a few explorations into forkable learning environments, pre-packaged with content. The goal was to make something th
	- at even a relatively new student could use to create and share their own set of practice problems -> [accessibly](((63f61887-d67b-4632-91d9-9b7ed2f1c0ff))) [open]([[Open Source]]) [education]([[Open Education]]).  To adapt the content "all" you need to do is fork the repository, turn on github pages static hosting and enable github actions.  After that any changes to the .js exercise files goes live automatically.
	- [debuggercises](https://github.com/DeNepo/debuggercises), [live](https://denepo.github.io/debuggercises): a series of examples and exercises introducing JS, inspired by [[PRIMM]], [[Notional Machine]] and [[Context is Content]]. Debuggercises eventually led to [[Module/Inside JS]]
	- [unit testing](https://github.com/DeNepo/unit-tests), [live](https://denepo.github.io/unit-tests): for functions + unit tests.
	- [fuzz testing](https://github.com/DeNepo/fuzz), [live](https://denepo.github.io/fuzz):  Inspired by [[Teaching Tech Together]], this is an environment for fuzz testing JavaScript functions. This led directly to the Fuzz Testing chapter in [[Module/Behavior, Strategy, Implementation]] and the `?fuzz` lens in [[Study Lenses]]
	- [JS koans](https://github.com/DeNepo/js-koans), [live](https://denepo.github.io/js-koans/?path=%2Fexercises%2Fabout-testing%2F1-expect.js): a little exploration of using koans in class, this one didn't go very far.
		- > In programming Koans are exercises, puzzles, or problems - typically presented as a suite of unit tests - intended to get developers up to speed with the idioms and features of a programming language. - [github topic](https://github.com/topics/koans)
