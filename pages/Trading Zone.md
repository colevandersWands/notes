	- how do [[Research-Practice Partnership]]s and [[Participatory Computing Education Research]] align (or not) with [Collins' model of Trading Zones]([[Trading Zones and Interactional Expertise]]) #question
	- how do [different types of trading zones]([[Trading Zones and Interactional Expertise]]) relate to different [disciplinary interactions]([[Multidisciplinarity, Interdisciplinarity, and Transdisciplinarity in Health Research, Services, Education and Policy: 1. Definitions, Objectives and Evidence of Effectiveness]])? #question

			- The second form is aroundÂ **interactional experts**, a person or group of people that learn enough about the interacting communities to be able to understand their practices, and that can discuss in the language of each community, while not becoming contributing experts. For example, a historian might learn to read and discuss publications from computer science, without the ability to publish computer science work themselves.
