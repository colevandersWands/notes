- Programming is complicated, there are many concepts to learn and all of the concepts are related in different ways. A naive way to look at this would be that you actually have two types of knowledge to build:
	- **Concepts**: The individual concepts of programming, things like _*variables*_ and _*APIs*_ and _*repositories*_. Studying each of these concepts separately will be important before moving on to ...
	- **Connections**: How the individual concepts are related. For example once you understand variables and arrays separately, you will still need to study _*reference vs. value*_ (how _*variables*_ store _*arrays*_ in memory).
- However, this two-component paradigm is not always the most useful way to think of things. Instead, what if Connections are thought of as just a more complex Concept?
	- When defining learning objectives, this framing can help to avoid overlooking or hand-waving away tricky and important objectives like _reference vs. value_.
	- Then you'll make room in your learning objectives and schedule to teach this properly
	- Making space in your curriculum for these tricky connecting concepts may also help with [[Learner Trust]] by implicitly acknowledging that something will be challenging, and the learner isn't expected to "just figure it out" or "get it later". #question
- This raises the question of how to decide which "connectiony" learning objectives can be isolated and to what extent. Answering this question can help you scope and structure your curriculum
