- From [The "I" in PRIMM](https://helloworld.raspberrypi.org/articles/hw14-the-i-in-primm) -> [[Block Model]]
	- Following the approach, teachers can structure programming lessons with five elements: Predict, Run, Investigate, Modify, and Make:
	  1. **Predict:** Students discuss a program and predict what it might do, drawing or writing out what they think will be the output. At this level, the focus is on the function of the code.
	  2. **Run:** Students run the program so that they can test their prediction and discuss in class.
	  3. **Investigate:** The teacher provides a range of activities to explore the structure of the code; this involves activities such as tracing, explaining, annotating, and debugging.
	  4. **Modify:*** *Students edit the program to change its functionality via a sequence of increasingly challenging exercises; the transfer of ownership moves from the code being ‘not mine’ to ‘partly mine’ as students gain confidence by extending the function of the code.
	  5. **Make:** Students design a new program that uses the same structures but solves a new problem (e.g. has a new function).

- i wonder about [[PRIMM]]
	- what aspects of code make it "easy" or "difficult" to read? to what extent is it possible to create a "graded reader" for code ... either via taking authentic code and "simplifying it", or grouping different code examples into classes differentiated along the (many?) axes of simply to complexity. #question #adam
	- can [[PRIMM]] + [[Study Lenses]] help [[Computing Education]] adjust to AI code generation? #question
		- i think so because with PRIMM code is content, not the final deliverable.  with proper configuration you can generate code of any level with different mixes of language features then have learners examine the code.
		- even "bad" generated code is good content since it's a point of discussion. readability, efficiency, ...
		- and code plagiarized by AI is also a good entry point into intellectual property rights, attribution, ...
