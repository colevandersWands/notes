- Focus your teaching and assessment on the steps a learner takes to complete an assignment, not the final product.  This principle should be applied at every level of curriculum design from the overall course objectives, to assessment, to every granular exercise and reference.

	- yes: "build any web page you want, just be sure to follow this [planning and collaborating](https://github.com/DeNepo/planning-and-collaborating) process"
	- no: "build a twitter clone using x CSS framework"
- Does teaching processes instead of specific final projects help accommodate learners of different levels in one class? #question
	- i think yes because if the main [[Learning Objectives]] are procedural, then learners of different levels can (for example) practice the same development process on projects of different complexity.  Even if their code is very different they can help each other understand the process, which sometimes comes easier to learners whose coding level is less advanced
- An example of an explicit process for [planning and collaborating](https://github.com/DeNepo/planning-and-collaborating) designed for [[De Nepo Web Dev -- very WIP]]

	- it is agnostic to what framework or project is being built
	- the process was designed based on the principles of [[Spiderweb Curriculum]] and [[Full Complexity, Max Simplicity]] - learners first apply the process with HTML & CSS, and continue to apply the same process all the way through a group fullstack project.
	- the continual repetition of planning and collaboration in progressively more complex projects gives learners many chances to internalize the process in a variety of projects - [[4CID]] .
