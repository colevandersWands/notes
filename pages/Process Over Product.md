- the skills learned struggling to learn professional tasks or use professional tooling are almost always **__not__** the skills needed to complete the tasks fluidly and ... professionally.   There are far too many implicit skills and far too much implicit knowledge that developers take for granted.

- The difference between a competent programmer and an impressive programmer isn't so much what they build as how effortlessly they can build it. The competent programmer may need to spend days of hard study to arrive at the same finished code that the impressive developer could write in a couple hours.  This is because the impressive developer has impressive *_first instincts_*.  They intuitively ask and answer the right questions at the right time, moving them efficiently along to a good solution.
- Fortunately this can be learned!  By creating exercises that explicitly ask your students to complete a series of well-defined sub-tasks instead of simply providing open-ended challenges, you can help them to build reliable thought habits that will give them two whole legs up.
- "Practice makes permanent. Perfect practice makes perfect."
- Focus your teaching and assessment on the steps a learner takes to complete an assignment, not the final product.  This principle should be applied at every level of curriculum design from the overall course objectives, to assessment, to every granular exercise and reference.

	- yes: "build any web page you want, just be sure to follow this [planning and collaborating](https://github.com/DeNepo/planning-and-collaborating) process"
	- no: "build a twitter clone using x CSS framework"
- Does teaching processes instead of specific final projects help accommodate learners of different levels in one class? #question
	- i think yes because if the main [[Learning Objectives]] are procedural, then learners of different levels can (for example) practice the same development process on projects of different complexity.  Even if their code is very different they can help each other understand the process, which sometimes comes easier to learners whose coding level is less advanced

	- it is agnostic to what framework or project is being built
	- the process was designed based on the principles of [[Spiderweb Curriculum]] and [[Full Complexity, Max Simplicity]] - learners first apply the process with HTML & CSS, and continue to apply the same process all the way through a group fullstack project.
	- the continual repetition of planning and collaboration in progressively more complex projects gives learners many chances to internalize the process in a variety of projects - [[4CID]] .
