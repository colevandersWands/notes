- some of my first principles for teaching and designing CE, in no order with lots of room for improvement:
	- best practice should be common practice: make it easiest to do things right
	- agency & ownership: managing, adapting, and creating educational resources should be within the capabilities of the home community. (it's our responsibility to design with them, not their responsibility to figure out what we made).
	- work with who learners already trust to build what they need, one small step at a time ([[Translational Sprints]]): overly general & reusable open resources are doomed, trying to start new organizations is (often) doomed, broader institutional change is slow and an uphill battle
	- [[Open Source]] !== [[Open Education]] : open, useful, usable & used -> make sure adapting/adopting your resources is within technical abilities of your target audience
	- participation, humility and empathy are key to successful design
	- meet your learners where they are to accompany them where they want to go (culturally, intellectually, personally. in teaching, in curriculum design, in independent study).
	- everyone has something to learn and something to teach. you may be teaching coding, but what are your learners teaching you if you listen? you may be just learning to code, but what do you have that other developers don't?
	- [[Process Over Product]] : teach the processes a learner will use, not the product hey will produce
	- [[Context is Content]] : where and how a learner studies something should be a learning objective
	- [[Explicitly Teach the Implicit]] : isolate and teach skills professions use implicitly, don't leave students to learn these (or not!) by trial and error
	- integrative: tech education should build a wholistic understanding of the creative & controlling role programming plays at the center of a digital society. education should integrate this with the learner's lives and community, not superficially but at the base level of learning objectives and delivery
	- focus on "the whole game": teach the full context of programming in the simplest form possible. then grow the complexity of the context keeping the individual components as simple as possible at each step
	- rhetorical situation: there is no escape! every act is born in a context that it in turn helps to define.
	- software is written by someone, for a purpose. be that someone, choose your purpose
	- liberate the [[Means of Instruction]]!
