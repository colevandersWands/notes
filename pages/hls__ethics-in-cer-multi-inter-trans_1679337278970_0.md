- While calls to integrate ethics into computer science education go back decades, recent high-profile ethical failures related to computing technology by large technology companies, governments, and academic institutions have accelerated the adoption of computer ethics education at all levels of instruction. Discussions of how to integrate ethics into existing computer science programmes often focus on the structure of the intervention—embedded modules or dedicated courses, humanists or computer scientists as ethics instructors—or on the specific content to be included—lists of case studies and essential topics to cover. While proponents of computer ethics education often emphasize the importance of closely connecting ethical and technical content in these initiatives, most do not reflect in depth on the variety of ways in which the disciplines can be combined. In this paper, I deploy a framework from crossdisciplinary studies that categorizes academic projects that work across disciplines as multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, or transdisciplinary, depending on the degree of integration. When applied to computer ethics education, this framework is orthogonal to the structure and content of the initiative, as I illustrate using examples of dedicated ethics courses and embedded modules. It therefore highlights additional features of cross-disciplinary teaching that need to be considered when planning a computer ethics programme. I argue that computer ethics education should aim to be at least interdisciplinary—multidisciplinary initiatives are less aligned with the pedagogical aims of computer ethics—and that computer ethics educators should experiment with fully transdisciplinary education that could transform computer science as a whole for the better.

- An early typology, developed for an OECD report, identifies a discipline as “a specific body of teachable knowledge with its own background of education, training, procedures, methods and content areas” [ 2, p. 25]

- Or the integration of ethics and computing could be so thoroughgoing that the programme of study could be described as a social justice degree that makes heavy use of computing skills.

- For example, one way to interpret the emergence of cognitive science and of science and technology studies as distinctive fields is that the various disciplines studying the mind and the social aspects of technoscience respectively came together to create new concepts, methods, and theories that could not be produced within their progenitor disciplines [ 24 , 36]. Similarly, we might wonder what may emerge if ethics and computing were to become so closely integrated as to produce a new discipline of research and education.

- This last point is one I want to emphasize: a transdisciplinary approach to computer ethics would make ethical success at least as important as technical success in computing generally.

- How could transdisciplinary computer ethics be achieved in a computer science education context? Here is a speculative outline of some elements of a transdisciplinary Introduction to Computer Science course.

- However, this raises the main disadvantage of a transdisciplinary approach to teaching and research: even more than interdisciplinary projects, transdisciplinary work requires significant investment of time, resources, and personnel to be successful. What is more, academic incentives may act against transdisciplinary work, requiring administrators to cooperate in redefining hiring, retention, and tenure criteria.

- These are common challenges across transdisciplinary endeavours, however. Considering the successes of transdisciplinary projects in other fields may be instructive to those seeking an ethical transformation of computer science.

- But a transdisciplinary responsible computing education—and the transformed computing professions that graduates thereof may help to produce—could well be a modern alternative [cf. 13, pp. 16–17].

- A transdisciplinary computer ethics education programme would be successful were it to reliably produce experts in computer ethics and experts in other subfields of computing, each of whom have enough complementary technical or ethical knowledge to be interactional experts[9 ] with the others.
