	- there are [[Computing Education Research Center]]s, that conduct [[Open Research]], coordinate [[Research Programmes/Translational]] and [[Research Programmes/Theoretical]], foster [[Trading Zone]]/[[Boundary Objects]], ...
	- [[Computing Education Research Center]]s support [[Model Course]]s
		- by helping to coordinate and support [[Research-Practice Partnership]]s
		- or even by hosting the [[Model Course]] themselves
	- help to imagine new roles for computing and new computing professions, then helping make this a reality through education
