- i discovered this term in [[Debugging: The key to unlocking the mind of a novice programmer?]]
	- ((6400a3c9-ccb2-4a39-97c5-3a956f142898))
	- it's originally from Perkins' book "Making Learning Whole: How Seven Principles of Teaching Can Transform Education"
	- i haven't read the book, but my shallow understanding makes it sound like a very useful term to unify many of the design principles i've gathered over the years including: [[Spiderweb Curriculum]], [[Rhetorics of Programming]], [[Connections are Concepts]], [[Process Over Product]], [[Full Complexity, Max Simplicity]], [[4CID]], [[Spiral Curriculum]]
