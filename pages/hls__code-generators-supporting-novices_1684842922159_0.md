- AI code generators like OpenAI Codex have the potential to assist novice programmers by generating code from natural language descriptions, however, over-reliance might negatively impact learning and retention. To explore the implications that AI code generators have on introductory programming, we conducted a controlled experiment with 69 novices (ages 10-17). Learners worked on 45 Python code-authoring tasks, for which half of the learners had access to Codex, each followed by a code-modifcation task. Our results show that using Codex signifcantly increased codeauthoring performance (1.15x increased completion rate and 1.8x higher scores) while not decreasing performance on manual codemodifcation tasks. Additionally, learners with access to Codex during the training phase performed slightly better on the evaluation post-tests conducted one week later, although this diference did not reach statistical signifcance. Of interest, learners with higher Scratch pre-test scores performed signifcantly better on retention post-tests, if they had prior access to Codex.
