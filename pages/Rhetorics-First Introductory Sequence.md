- we need to #unask what programming to teach first, and instead ask "how do we teach _how_ and _why_ programming happens?".
	- how do groups of people  develop, deploy and use software to create meaning and shape society?
- computing education's ["first"](((63f60cad-216a-41dd-9343-53e4640ebb3a))) could be the [[Rhetorics of Programming]], with different [[Rhetorical Situation]]s defined for different learning paths
	- {{embed ((6401c5cc-2dd2-48e4-99cc-3741ef1a0e96))}}
	- _**note**: this is not the same as [[Rhetorical Code Studies]]! I am suggesting to use Rhetorics as a framing mechanism for introductions to programming. I am not suggesting to replace introductory programming with deep-dive rhetorical analysis._
- these Rhetorical Situations could be layered into a [[Spiderweb Curriculum]].  i can imagine learning paths being described as a [[Knowledge Graph]] of rhetorical situations, where learners get to specialize not by deciding _what_ languages or technologies to learn but by deciding _where_ and _how_ they'd like to apply what they learn.
	- this approach could make it easier to approach the "CS0"/"programming for non-majors"/"programming in X discipline" question by providing one introductory class that sets the stage for a wide variety of paths: CS, software development, [[Conversational Programmers]], ...
	- [[Integrating Ethics into Introductory Programming Classes]] becomes natural, a Rhetorical Situation prioritizes bigger questions over technical details
	- rhetorics-first lends itself to [[PRIMM]], or better ... PRISMM? Predict -> Run -> Investigate -> Situate -> Modify -> Make.
		- PRIMM : PRISMM :: STEM : STEAM #question
	- i wonder about [[Rhetorics-First Introductory Sequence]]
		- are large language models a boon to rhetorics-first?  R-F is [[PRIMM]]-heavy, so educators won't need to manually create all examples. and the issues surrounding LLM code generators (security, IP, efficiency, ...) all make great talking points.   #question
- Rhetorics-first could be effective for [[Agile Continuous Education]].
	- different careers and positions will have different rhetorical situations
	- ACE expects that you will not learn everything in class but will do lots of on-the-job training.
	- by defining ACE courses with a rhetorical situation you can spend (relatively) little time in the classroom preparing learners to integrate quickly on the job, where they could do most of their technical learning #hypothesis
- i imagine the first modules taken by everyone could be:
	- **Big Picture 1**: *multiple humans collaborating on one body of text*.
		- Objectives: IDE, git/hub, task management, collaboration, "code" review, ethics, ...
		- this course has been prototyped using only Markdown which is simple enough to not distract - [[Module/Workflows]]
		- ![rhetorical-situation-text-collaboration.svg](../assets/rhetorical-situation-text-collaboration_1678361608787_0.svg)
	- **Big Picture 2**: *then multiple humans collaborating on a text that a computer must also interpret*.
		- this could be covered with HTML & CSS because it's motivating, static pages easily go public, there is no heavy [[Notional Machine]] for markup languages.
		- Objectives: task decomposition, code quality, development methodologies, project constraints, ...
		- a possible bonus to starting this way is the (relative) domain-independence of building a static web page.  learners can [bring their own culture]([[Culturally Responsive Computing: a theory revisited]]) to the projects.
		- emphasizing [[Process Over Product]] would additionally free learners to choose the _topic_ of their projects without evading the primary [[Learning Objectives]]
		- prototype curriculum - [[Module/Agile Development]]
		- ![rhetorical-situation-with-computer.svg](../assets/rhetorical-situation-with-computer_1678362524147_0.svg)
	- after these two modules, learners would be able to choose different paths.  Two possible paths include (but are not limited to!):
		- **Software Development**: --> [[Rhetorics of Programming/Apps]]
			- **SD 1**: *multiple humans developing software to reach other humans*.
				- Objectives: design thinking, user empathy, accessibility, ...
				- this course has been prototyped using HTML, CSS and CSS libraries - [[Module/UX-UI Design]]
				- ![rhetorical-situation-sd-1.svg](../assets/rhetorical-situation-sd-1_1678369642231_0.svg)
				  id:: 6409e35e-6d4e-4263-81f7-69768f2cf294
			- **SD 2**: *SD1 + event and data processing*
				- Objectives: code splitting, testing, CI/CD, [event-driven programming]([[Event-driven Programming in Programming Education: A Mapping Review]]), ...
				- ((5939fb5c-4688-4ea9-930a-47d7f4a63a52))
		- **Data Science** --> [[Rhetorics of Programming/Data Science]]
			- **DS 1**: *how humans can use computers to interrogate and understand data*
				- Objectives: basics of programming, questioning data quality, ...
				- ![rhetorical-situation-ds-1.svg](../assets/rhetorical-situation-ds-1_1678370358112_0.svg)
			- **DS 2**: *how humans can use computers & data to interrogate, understand and change the world*
				- Objectives:  data collection techniques & strategies, data modeling, ethics of data science & data modeling,  ...
				- a prototype of this curriculum --> [[ReACT Digital Projects 2022]]
