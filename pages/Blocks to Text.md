- [Blocks to Text](https://github.com/blocks-to-text/) is something I made a few years ago about the transition(s) learners make as they move from programming with blocks to programming with text.  It is many things:
	- [a conference presentation](https://blocks-to-text.github.io/sett-namur-19/#/)
	- a proof-of-concept block-based editor ([Side by Side](https://blocks-to-text.github.io/side-by-side/)) that supports writing Python with blocks and studying the generated text-based code side by side.  It also features a very early web-based prototype of the [[Study Lenses]] concept, and basic not-taking.
	- [a guide](https://github.com/blocks-to-text/top) for teachers
	- and an an exploration form and medium.  How could I use a github organization, repositories, and static hosting to publish all of the above as one whole?  Besides curiosity, this was practice for organizing [[Open Research]] and [[Open Education]]
- The very broad idea behind everything in Blocks to Text is that it's not actually one transition, but two:
