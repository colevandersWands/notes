- i wonder about the [[Rhetorics of Programming]]
	- how can you define useful [[Rhetorical Situation]]s for different types of programming? #question
	- can [[Rhetorics of Programming]] & the [[Spiderweb Curriculum]] provide the basis for methodically integrating ethics with introductory programming?  #question

		- My experience says yes, and that introducing [[Design Thinking]] early on is part of this

	- what if [[Rhetorical Situation]]s, not learning objectives, were the first step of curriculum and certification design? #question [[Rhetorics-First Introductory Sequence]]

		- the progression of courses/modules could add layers and complexity to the RS
		- the constraints placed by the RS would help define learning objectives -> [[Spiderweb Curriculum]]
		- can this address issues with over-engineered learning objectives? (#todo dig into [[CSK8]] episode references)

		- How does teaching "computational thinking" fit into this? and [[Notional Machine]]s? and [[Rhetorics-First Introductory Sequence]]?
