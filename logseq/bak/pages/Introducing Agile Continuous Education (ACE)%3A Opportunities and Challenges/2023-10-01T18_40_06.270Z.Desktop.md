- **Abstract:**
	- The rapid pace of innovation is challenging industries to train professionals with updated skill-sets in a continuous and rapid manner. Current academic systems enable expertise acquisition primarily through graduate-level programs. While such programs are valuable, they can also be somewhat monolithic for full-time employees balancing personal, professional, and financial obligations.
	- MIT Open Learning is currently developing what we refer to as an agile continuous education (ACE) model, which will provide education in a flexible, cost- and time- efficient manner, by combining modalities: online (such as MITx micro-credentials), on-site (such as MIT Bootcamps), and at-work-site (through apprenticeships and professionally mentored project-work).
	- This more granular approach affords a degree of freedom to students in their professional lives by: (a) letting them try new content before pursuing full-time academic programs; (b) acquiring content and credentials in smaller bite-sized chunks; (c) allowing them to customize their path based on personal preferences and rapidly-evolving industry needs; (d) applying learned skills and knowledge in more rapid cycles; (e) enabling these benefits in a more cost-effective manner.
	- This ACE model is promising but also challenging. First, designed programs must faithfully apply the science of learning. Second, these new building blocks must be standardized. Third, a new paradigm for unified transcripts is needed to accredit and record achievements. Finally, we are concerned utilitarian approaches to designing this system might lead us to neglect foundational aspects of education (i.e. humanities, field that must be preserved in any change). This paper introduces the ACE model and discusses unique advantages and challenges.
