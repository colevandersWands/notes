- Take the space in your learning objectives and the time in your class to explicitly teach skills that experienced developers take for granted, or don't even notice.  Such as knowing where to start reading in a file of code, or how to write a good internet search. Don't leave these skills to be (maybe) learned correctly by trial and error.

- Name things!  especially tiny things that experienced programmers usually take for granted; this can help emphasize that it's important, not something a learner is expected to know ahead of time, something worth spending time to learn, and naming things is generally helpful for discourse. Some examples of things to name:
