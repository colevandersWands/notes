- "_Learning to read_ to _read to learn_".  is this really a thing?  how does(?) it translate to programming?
	- reading is not creating text, while programming is
- [[Integrating Ethics into Introductory Programming Classes]]:
	- this article describes coding to learn about ethics, but also mentions that difficulty with coding can distract from the ethics

		  > Research now shows that "Learning to Read" and "Reading to Learn" should occur (1) simultaneously and (2) continually throughout a child's elementary and secondary years of education. (citations?)
		- > Fundamental decoding and sight-word skills, supposedly developed during grades Kâ€“3, should continue to be emphasized and taught as students confront more challenging information, text, and literature associated with new content areas and academic disciplines.
		- > Children that are "good readers" typically possess fundamental reading skills AND have a little bit of knowledge about different things.
			- programming exists very differently in different domains, and expertise programming in one domain does not promise expertise in another.
				- #todo find back the citation about experts in one domain being measured as novices in another
- i wonder about [[Coding to Learn]]
	- "_Learning to code_ to _coding to learn_" - does this analogy even hold? or might it only apply to reading programs, not writing them?   #question
	- does the [[Spiral Curriculum]] & [[Spiderweb Curriculum]] support [simultaneous and continual development](((6401b4d4-2abd-4712-bd45-b44dd4860da3))) of both LtR & RtL?  how is this even measured?  #question
	- in programming does the RtL half refer to learning more about good programs by reading them, or learning more about the domain? #question [[Block Model]]
	- how does [naming things](((6400a7e1-aa84-44b0-862a-eb675e2ec335))) interact with CtL-LtC? #question
