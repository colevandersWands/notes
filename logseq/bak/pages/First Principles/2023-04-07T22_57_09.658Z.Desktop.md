- [[Explicitly Teach the Implicit]]: isolate and teach skills experts take for granted, don't leave students to learn these (or not!) by trial and error
- [[Process Over Product]]:  teach the processes a learner will use, not the product hey will produce
- [[Full Complexity, Max Simplicity]]:  teach the full context of programming in the simplest form possible. then grow the complexity of the context keeping the individual components as simple as possible at each step
- [[Open Source !== Open Education]]
- [[Context is Content]]: where and how a learner studies something should be a learning objective
- liberate the [[Means of Instruction]]!
- [[Open, Useful, Usable, Used]]
- software is written by someone, for a purpose. be that someone, choose your purpose
- All computing is embedded in [[Rhetorical Situation]]s that it in turn helps to define. there is no escape!
- the best designs come from participation, empathy, and humility.
- design around the lives of your learners, don't expect the inverse.
- everyone has something to teach and something to learn.
