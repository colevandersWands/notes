- a variation of [[PRIMM]] with an extra step to situate programs in the wider world and explore their societal implications:
	- **P**_redict_ what the program will do, be as precise as possible
	- **R**_un_ the program to check your prediction, carefully describe how your prediction was correct and incorrect
	- **I**_nvestigate_ the program (static & dynamic) to understand how and why it works
	- **S**_ituate_ the program in a broader context ([rhetorical]([[Rhetorics-First Introductory Sequence]]), technical, professional, ...) to understand who made it, why they made it, who it impacts, and how.
	- **M**_odify_ the program to make small but intentional changes in it's behavior, modify the situation to explore/discuss different roles the program could play in it's context
	- **M**_ake_ a new program with a specific rhetorical goal in mind inspired by S & M, using technical approaches you learned in I & M.

	- can this help [[Integrating Ethics into Introductory Programming Classes]] without technical details distracting?  the extra explicit "situation" step could make space to focus on ethical questions without feeling like it takes time away from technical learning #question

	- how correlated are aptitudes reading and programming? if close, is that why PRI(S)MM works?
