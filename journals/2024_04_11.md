  I work with six other software engineers on a codebase of about 500k lines; about 750 different scripts across ten subsystems.
  
  The scripts use multiple styles, frameworks, and no less than seven different programming languages.
  
  Our site has millions of users, running 24/7 using 12 servers.
  
  As a full-stack developer, I am regularly asked to work on any part of the system.
  
  As a comparison, imagine you are a writer, assigned to update a series of ten 200+ page novels, written by multiple people over a decade.
  
  Parts of each novel are written in English, Spanish, German, Italian, French, Portuguese, and even some Klingon.
  
  The stories are connected to a common world, but each novel contains intricate details about hundreds of different unique characters who live and interact in this world.
  
  Every day, you need to improve parts of the story in one or more of the novels, without creating inconsistencies in the related stories.
  
  Your grammar, spelling, and punctuation must be perfect in all languages.
  
  Keep it coordinated with what six co-authors are writing every day too. And donâ€™t cause problems in official canon, because millions of fans will complain.
  
  Good luck!
